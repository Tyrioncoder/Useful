hdr depends upon
  luminance
  bit depth
  dynamic range
  color space

luminance - how bright device can emit . Candela/m2 or nits. Indorr lcd- 120 nits. laptops- 400 nits

crt displays - 100 nits. and std DR video( white point) was also calibrated to 100 nits

DR partally depends on contrast ratio 1000:1 types.

Color space- Rec709/ sRGB

  Rec 2020 > DCI P3( apple's ) > sRGB

  HDR uses 10 bit depth

  Our eyes - Can see difference in low light more and after certain brightness threshold, merely perceives any difference. 

  On the other hand, camera is opposite. Very low amount of data in low light ( 4 bits to represent) and high data bits in bright light( 128 bits). This is linear response( given voltage to perceived bright)

  So gamma curve brings that linear response to how we actually see by opposing it ( bringing the perceived brightness to low so that eyes can see more)

  displays again uses gamma curve to make into liner again( maybe)
